# Hi, I'm Akash 👋

**Full-Stack/JavaScript Enthusiast** from **West Bengal, India**

I'm a passionate learner and aspiring web developer currently diving deep into modern JavaScript, React, Node.js, and everything in between. I believe in writing clean, predictable code and sharing what I learn — that's why I started this small blog/portfolio.

### What I'm Focusing On Right Now (2026)
- Mastering JavaScript and best practices (like strict equality — see my latest post!)
- Building small projects to solidify concepts (coming soon to the Projects section)
- Exploring frontend frameworks (React, maybe Next.js next)
- Contributing to open source when I feel ready

### Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Currently Learning**: React • TypeScript • Git & GitHub workflows
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, Chrome DevTools, npm/yarn/bun, Jekyll (for this site!)
- **Soft Skills**: Problem-solving, writing technical explanations, curiosity

### A Bit About Me Personally
- 📍 Based in **W.B** — love the food, the chaos, and the winters
- 🎯 Goal for 2026: Land my first internship/dev role and publish 10+ blog posts
- 🌱 Always learning: Currently reading "You Don't Know JS" series
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once spent 4 hours debugging because I used `==` instead of `===` 😅

### Why This Portfolio Exists
This site is my way of documenting progress, forcing myself to explain concepts clearly, and showing potential employers/recruiters that I can:
- Write & structure content
- Use Git & deploy (GitHub Pages + Jekyll)
- Understand core JS deeply
